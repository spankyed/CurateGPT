Our tests suggest that the plug-ins significantly enhance\nGPT's ability to solve these problems. Having said that, there are still often\n\"interface\" failures; that is, GPT often has trouble formulating problems in a\nway that elicits useful answers from the plug-ins. Fixing these interface\nfailures seems like a central challenge in making GPT a reliable tool for\ncollege-level calculation problems.",
